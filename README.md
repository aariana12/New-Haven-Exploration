In order to run the project, you need to install NodeJS and Vite on your local computer. Your local computer also needs to have the latest version of Python installed. Once you have all of these installed on your computer, open the zip file and get all of the files necessary for the program. Once all the files are downloaded and everything is right, you need to start the localhost (since we included Google Maps API). This can be done by running python3 -m http.server 8000. Then, on Google Chrome, enter localhost:8000 in the url bar. This will now run the program on your local computer.

In order to run the project on the display, simply enter http://cpsc484-04.yale.internal:8888/?project=JEENA-Project into the URL bar. Now, you should be able to see the project on the display!
