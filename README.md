In order to run the project, you need to install NodeJS and Vite on your local computer. Also make sure you have homebrew isntalled. Your local computer also needs to have the latest version of Python installed. Once you have all of these installed on your computer, open the zip file and get all of the files necessary for the program. Once all the files are downloaded and everything is right, you need to start the localhost (since we included Google Maps API). This can be done by running python3 -m http.server 8000. Then, on Google Chrome, enter localhost:8000 in the url bar. This will now run the program on your local computer.

In order to run the project on the display, simply enter http://cpsc484-04.yale.internal:8888/?project=JEENA-Project into the URL bar. Now, you should be able to see the project on the display!


This project allows students to discover new places around the New Haven area. This project is different from simply searching something up on Google because it has input from other students themselves. Students are able to give their favorite places, and they're encouraged to send in places that are niche and less known by the student population. In this way, students can find new places to eat at or relax.

For our tasks in Assignment 5, one of them has a bit of a change. One of our tasks was "Eye catching and relevant “sleep” screen to catch bypassers while also allowing for feedback." However, we got a point taken off because it was not described as a task. So, in order to edit the task, we planned on implementing a scrolling list of random events occurring in New Haven in the sleep screen. This would be eye catching and cause the students to stop and look at our display. We were able to accomplish this and our home screen has a scrolling list of events that people can look at as they're walking by. Our second task was to display maps of the New Haven area with clear indicators of the locations where people have shown interest. We were able to implement this feature by integrating the Google Maps API into our project. Once on the map, students would be able to see the comments that previous students have left for why they love that location. For the constraints, this project doesn't really have that many. You have to stand a bit close to the display and make sure you're using your left hand to hover. Try to keep your right hand down by your side. In addition, the hover is very sensitive, so try to keeo your hand steady in order to hover over your selection.

COLLABORATION REPORT:

Ariana Delgado ad2528: I figured out how to implement the Google Maps API by starting a local host. In addition, I was able to learn how to use npm in order to "npm run build" the map files and actually have them work with our project. After this, I was able to edit the actual map window in order to include the comments by the students that submitted our Google Form. I edited the Google Maps API to include the markers for each of the locations that people suggested. I also went to office hours and was present during our class time (April 25) to see how our project would work on the display. I worked with the TA's to figure out how to debug our project, since it was not working on the display initially. With their help, I was able to debug the project and get the kienct display to work (previously it had only been working on localhost:8000 but not the actual display).
