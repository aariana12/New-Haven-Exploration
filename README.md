In order to run the project, you need to install NodeJS and Vite on your local computer. Your local computer also needs to have the latest version of Python installed. Once you have all of these installed on your computer, open the zip file and get all of the files necessary for the program. Once all the files are downloaded and everything is right, you need to start the localhost (since we included Google Maps API). This can be done by running python3 -m http.server 8000. Then, on Google Chrome, enter localhost:8000 in the url bar. This will now run the program on your local computer.

In order to run the project on the display, simply enter http://cpsc484-04.yale.internal:8888/?project=JEENA-Project into the URL bar. Now, you should be able to see the project on the display!

My main contribution was to connect the website to the Kinect sensor, which makes the left wrist act as a cursor. This was an all-night and day endeavor, to try and connect to the display and first have the program work on my computer. Then, I needed to connect the feedback from the Kinect positioning, transpose it to the dimensions of the computer/screen with respect to the body pelvis. I then had to track a hovering counter with the DOMRect objects, and then click after a certain amount of time. I configured the buttons to increase in saturation according to the progress of when the hovering will trigger the click. I also made the QR form, QR code, QR code page, and the automatic refresher after 10 seconds to redirect to the home page. I included a home and exit button (that redirects to QR page) on the prompt page as well as included those icons in the index.html file. I worked with Ariana Delgado on figuring out the display local host problems with the 2 TAs at our display after my all-nighter, and tried to get the home and exit buttons on the map pages as well. I communicated my availability and made sure that my contributions would not impact the others' work before I was able to work on my own. I communicated in the group chat what things could be done and when I expected to finish mine by.
